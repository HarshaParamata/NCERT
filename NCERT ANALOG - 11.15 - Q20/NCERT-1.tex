\ Question:
A travelling harmonic wave on a string is described by
$$ y(x,t) = 7.5 \sin(0.0050x + 12t + \frac{\pi}{4}) $$

\ (a) What are the displacement and velocity of oscillation of a point at $x = 1\,\ cm $ and $t = 1\,s $? Is this velocity equal to the velocity of wave propagation?

\ (b) Locate the points of the string which have the same transverse displacements and velocity as the $x = 1\,\ cm $ point at $t = 2 \,\ s $, $t = 5 \,\ s $, and $t = 11 \,\ s $.
